# Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a **network** of physical devices embedded with **sensors**, software, and other technologies that enable them to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. IoT devices can range from everyday objects like smart home devices to sophisticated industrial tools. These devices collect data from their environment, communicate over the internet, and can respond intelligently to users. IoT systems typically consist of smart devices, IoT applications that analyze data, and a graphical user interface for device management.

## Digital Twins

A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical product, system, or process that serves as a digital counterpart for various purposes such as simulation, testing, monitoring, and maintenance.  Digital twins use real-time data from **sensors** to simulate the behavior of the physical object and monitor its performance throughout its lifecycle.
