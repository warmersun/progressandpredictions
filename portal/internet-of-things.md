# Internet of Things

## IOT

The internet of things (IoT) is a term that refers to the growing network of physical objects that are connected to the internet. These objects, which are also known as "smart" or "connected" devices, are equipped with sensors that allow them to collect and exchange data.

One of the main ideas behind the internet of things is to connect everyday objects, such as appliances, cars, and even clothing, to the internet, allowing them to be controlled and monitored remotely. For example, a smart thermostat can be programmed to adjust the temperature in your home based on your preferences, and a connected car can alert you if there is a problem with your vehicle's engine.

Another important aspect of the internet of things is the ability for these connected devices to communicate with each other and share data. For instance, a smart home system can use data from a connected thermostat, security camera, and smoke detector to create a comprehensive picture of the state of your home, and even automatically take actions based on that information.

Overall, the internet of things is about creating a network of connected devices that can gather and share data, making our lives more efficient, convenient, and safe.

## Edge Computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing model in which data is processed at the edge of a network, rather than in a central location. In this model, data is processed by the devices that are _closest_ to where it is generated, rather than being sent over the internet to a remote server for processing.

One of the main advantages of edge computing is that it can help to reduce latency, or the delay between when data is generated and when it is processed. By processing data closer to its source, edge computing can enable real-time analytics and decision making, which is important for applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and augmented reality.

Another benefit is that it can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the internet, which can help to reduce network congestion and save on bandwidth costs. Additionally, by processing data locally, edge computing can also improve security, as sensitive data does not need to be transmitted over the internet where it is potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks.
