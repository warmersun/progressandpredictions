# We Are Not Wired Like This

We evolved, coming from the savanna of Africa.

When our ancestors were trying to survive what did it matter what was happening on the far side of the globe? It didnâ€™t.there was no advantage in the Darwinian race. The survival of the fittest required us to focus on dangers that are near. Local.

We are also wired to think linear.

We can solve a differential equation when we catch a ball. Our amigdala can make fight or flight decisions quickly. When we see a l running towards us we can calculate where we will be by the time it arrives.

We rarely need to deal with exponential growth in nature.

Is that actually true? Searching for applications of exponential function in physics brings up the **radio active decay**, the **capacitor discharge** and **dated oscillators**... certainly not something our ancestors would have had to worry about.

This all has changed. The world is not local and linear anymore.

The world is no longer local and linear; only our thinking is. True transcendence means overcoming the evolved limitations of our brain - a bit like Nash did it in A Beautiful Mind. We need to develop skills to think global and exponential.

We need cognitive tools to deal with it.
