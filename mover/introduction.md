The **Mover** is the power to move things. Either you move matter, tangible things in the world of atoms; or you move and distribute information. Bits.

_Networking_ gives the ability for communication, moving bits. _Transportation_ technology on the other hand moves physical things and can happen autonomously:

* &#x20;in the air - with drones
* on land - with self-driving cars and trucks
* ...also, on water even into space.
