# Point to Point

When you want to travel point to point but the roads don't go that way... you cannot do it on the surface;  you have two options...

### Go Up ... into the sky

The pivotal vehicle technology behind Uber Air is Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP), which enables fault-tolerance in the vertical lift system, increasing safety, reducing maintenance costs, and making operations up to 100 times quieter than conventional helicopters. DEP, combined with current battery performance, lightweight materials, and automation, allows for the development of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft suitable for dense urban areas. These aircraft are engineered for safety and will be certified by relevant civil aviation authorities. The DEP architecture provides redundancy at multiple levels, resulting in quieter aircraft with nearly silent overflight capabilities. Uber Air eVTOL aircraft are designed to fly at speeds of 150 mph or more at altitudes of 1,000 to 2,000 feet above ground level, with a range of up to 60 miles. Uber plans to offer pooled trips with up to 4 passengers in addition to the pilot, aiming to make aerial mobility sustainable and affordable for a large part of the community. The fully electric aircraft generate zero emissions during flight and are part of the solution to address climate change challenges.

### Go Down ... and dig

The Boring Company aims to address traffic congestion by advocating for the use of tunnels as a solution. Tunnels are considered advantageous over flying cars as they are weatherproof, hidden from view, and do not pose the risk of falling on individuals. They also make efficient use of land and do not interfere with existing transportation systems. The company's Loop system, exemplified by the LVCC Loop in Las Vegas, offers zero-emissions underground transportation directly to destinations without intermediate stops. Additionally, the introduction of Prufrock, a high-speed tunneling machine, is set to revolutionize infrastructure construction by significantly reducing project timelines.
