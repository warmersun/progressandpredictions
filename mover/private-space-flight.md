### Takeaways

There were private (rich) people before who got to go into space... what's different this time is that the launches, the vehicles, the passengers everything is private companies.

* Space is no longer for national space agencies only - **you don't have to become a NASA astronaut**
* **You don't** even **have to be a millionaire**, because the price dropped to a "few" hundred thousands

You can launch your own _cubesat_ ( a small, 10cm X 10cm X 10cm satellite) into space for ... ?
