# Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are developed to mimic human form and behaviors, allowing them to operate in human-centric environments without needing specialized infrastructure. They enable more intuitive interactions, can perform a variety of tasks ranging from household chores to industrial applications, and are used in education and entertainment. These robots also serve critical roles in unsafe conditions, such as disaster zones or hazardous environments, enhancing safety and efficiency.

 There could be around 1 billion humanoid robots on Earth by the 2040s. Humanoid robots could eventually outnumber humans.

 we will need to rethink economy. We currntly measure economic output as product per capita (per person)... what happens when the number of persons no longer matters?

Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus, which Elon Musk believes could have a two-order magnitude potential improvement in economic output. He has also mentioned that the cost of these robots could be less than $20,000 per unit, and that they could be produced in the millions.
