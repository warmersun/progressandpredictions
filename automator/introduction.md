We can think about each emerging technology as a **superpower**.

Superpowers work in two realms: the physical world where things are tangible, made of material, made of “stuff” – the world of atoms\
and in the realm of imagination, intuition - the digital world of bits.

(See the red ones (1) and zeros (0) ? ... those represent bits. The blue flower looking things are atoms)

**Automator** is the first superpower we will learn about.

The **Automator** is the power to _automate_ things. In the world of bits and information it means creating programs that “think” by themselves. In the world of atoms, it goes further, having machines that do stuff on their own.

_Artificial Intelligence (AI_) and _Robots_ give the abilities for automation.&#x20;

(Of course they both rely on Computing as well as other things like _Energy._)
