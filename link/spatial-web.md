# Spatial Web

Let me try my own definition: spatial web is making Augmented Reality that is aware of the real world's physical, 3D environment and location.

Imagine putting a non-existent, virtual coffee mug on the table for your friend to find the next day.

It will allow persistent digital overlays on top of the real world.
