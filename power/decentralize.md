# ðŸ˜… Decentralize

What system can you think of that is currently **centralized** and could benefit from a complete redesign and rethinking in a decentralized way?

As an example: My favorite is _education_

Think about it:

* who decides how the funding - from our collected taxes - is allocated and spent?
* who decides on what to learn? the curriculum
* who owns and operates the buildings where it takes place?
* who hires and pays the teachers?
* how can you prove that you passed a test, graduated? who holds the credentials?

you can elaborate on rethinking school and educationâ€¦ or suggest something else that can similarly be decentralizedâ€¦
