# Longevity Escape Velocity

Escape velocity is the minimum speed that an object needs to have in order to be able to escape the gravitational pull of a planet or other celestial body. In other words, it is the speed at which an object can overcome the force of gravity and break free from the object's surface.

Longevity escape velocity, on the other hand, refers to the idea that if we can extend human lifespan at a rate that is faster than the rate at which people are dying, then we will be able to continually extend lifespan indefinitely. In other words, once we reach longevity escape velocity, we will be able to keep people alive forever, or at least for a very long time. This concept is still largely theoretical and not yet possible with our current technology, but it is now "within sight".
