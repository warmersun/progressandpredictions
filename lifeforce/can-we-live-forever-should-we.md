# ðŸ˜… Can We Live Forever? Should We?

Interesting (to me at least) that some people do not want to live forever.\
Let me phrase it: if you could live in good health in peace and prosperity surrounded by freinds and family; not drooling in a wheelchain, more like you 40 or 30 year old self... would you ever want it to end and die?
